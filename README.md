 Image Captioning AI 🔥✨

An AI-powered image captioning tool that generates trendy, Gen Z-style captions for your photos.

## Features
- 📸 Drag-and-drop or click to upload images
- 🎨 Smart color and brightness analysis
- ✨ Gen Z aesthetic captions with emojis
- 💫 Real-time processing with clean UI
- 🔥 Adaptive captions based on image vibes (bright, dark, warm, cool, vibrant)

## How It Works
The app simulates a deep learning pipeline:
1. **Feature Extraction**: Analyzes image using color analysis (simulates ResNet/VGG CNN)
2. **Caption Generation**: Creates contextual captions based on visual features (simulates LSTM/Transformer decoder)
3. **Output**: Delivers trendy, Gen Z-style captions that match your image's aesthetic

## Tech Stack
- React
- Lucide React Icons
- Tailwind CSS
- HTML5 Canvas API

## Demo Note
This is a demo using simulated processing. Production systems would use TensorFlow.js with pre-trained ResNet50 + LSTM decoder models trained on datasets like MS COCO.

## Usage
Simply upload an image and let the AI generate captions that hit differenT.
